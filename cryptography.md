Roles:

Bad Actors <- Important to call out crypto's natural assumption of bad participants vs political systems which are built on an idealistic assumption that participants are constantly benevolent
Maintainers of ledgers <- Miners, authorities, stakers. These get to create a collective memory of something.
Market Makers (traders) <- Historically these participants are incredibly valuable, but have only found their way into a position by some license granted by an intermediary
Authorities <- Every system will have someone who has more leverage than others (or else it couldn't exist. Think core developers/mining pools)
Transactors <- This covers the regular usecases. They are the most important but least sophisticated. UX is the most important of a system to this role.

Cryptographic elements:

Authentication, Non-Repudiation, Confidentiality, Integrity

Types of Proof:

Establishing what is true of the past. Covers hashes and signatures. Needs work. Need to reconcile math vs logic vs legal vs natural theology

Types of Agreement:

Establishing what is right to be done in the future. Consensus mechanisms, general staking schemes (escrows), randomness, queues, authorities

Types of Communication:

p2p networks

# Noise
## A Web3.0 Wrapper for Web2.0 Information Outlets 

**Networked Organization: A network composed of nodes of individuals and machines that have sufficient volume of interaction where relationships between nodes can be quantified in a meaningful way. This organization is only related in that it shares a common language and jargon but does not necessarily work towards a common goal and their outputs will be varied and sometimes loosely related. Networked organizations can cease to be networked organizations when interactions between certain nodes become too numerous to make meaningful judgements about, as conventional measurements of their interactions will not capture the relationships' quality.** 

**Core: An approximate grouping of the nodes in an organization with the most connections.**

**Community: Any node with an interactive (two-way) connection on the network.**

**Outsider: Any node with that only has one-way interaction with the network.**

**Public: The entire universe of unconnected nodes who could potentially have a one-way interaction (aka, become aware of or be impacted by) your network.**

### Abstract

This is a concept for a noise reduction platform of Web 2.0 information platform that facilitate the discussion and marketing efforts of networked organizations. It would be a layer on top of Twitter (initially) and other social media outlets that would allow users to more easily determine the vested interest of each participant in social media discussion and marketing and reduce spam. Noise will work by assigning identities to participants in discussion on open channels which will allow outsiders to determine the approximate function the individual has in the organization. By creating categorizations of individuals within a project we can then create formalized governance systems around pre-existing, but informal, social systems. The resulting categorizations can be combined with staking mechanisms to create all the properties required to allow permissionless networked organizations to mimic the functions of a board of directors in a publicly owned company. Noise focuses on engaging the external stakeholders of software project in a unique way to create apparent structure so that whole network of individuals that has an interest in the project can be involved in building the direction of the project.

### Intro

_Public Perception_

Most people hear of new networked organizations through Web2.0 social forums. In open source software networked organizations, tools like Twitter, Github, Stackoverflow, Reddit, Discourse, Slack, Discord, and Telegram reign supreme in forming people's opinions around specific products or features. This is especially true of esoteric or brand new organization where very few people have a working knowledge of the actual product. With the recent innovation of tying cryptocurrency valuation to the funding of open source project, the amount of noise on these social channels has become unbearable for people who are actually using and developing these projects. Discussion around price is often the dominant topic, and there is no barrier to entry into the conversation. Individuals can misrepresent their position, as we never know what interests members in the discussion maintain. Conflicts of interest are always assumed. This has led well-respected members of communities to withhold public support for fear of being misinterpreted as trying to pump a project. This means that intelligent conversation is often done behind closed doors via advisory positions, even though that discussion would be great to have on public forums for public edification. Without understanding individual's position in a project through some form of persistent identity leads to a massive public perception problem. The intentions of individuals promoting specific ideas on behalf of the project aren't easy to investigate, so to an uninformed observer of discussion all opinions are given similar amounts of consideration in the mind of the reader.

_Inexistence of Decentralized/Flat Organizations_

There is no such thing as pure decentralization. Operating in a truly "open environment" is impossible in practice when as there must be varying levels of permissions and authority to get anything done. The most obvious of these is the concept of a Benevolent Dictator for Life who maintains some special priviledge, such as merge permissions on a project, which assumes some final say in issues.  Sometimes the secrecy and efficiency of in-person closed-door interaction is still required due to the unexpected nature of any organization. There are times that special-purpose work groups are neccessary. All self-proclaimed "decentralized" or "open" projects will still have some element of closed & centralized work that would destroy the project if it were ever made public. Also, as anyone who has worked on a software project knows, private conversation is often the best way to vet bad ideas before they become broadly communicated. Temporary hierarchies and methods of determining relative legitimacy of actors are critical for simply getting things done. These relative measures of legitimacy, no matter how approximate, are beneficial to establish so that the community might be informed about who to go to for certain inquiries. An individual's position in the project is good to establish for outsiders to quickly assess the lay of the land when coming into a new network.

_Unified Marketing Messages_

When a project is leaderless, schisms in belief about how the technology is best applied are common. This problem is much worse when the economic factor of token appreciation or deprection is added to the equation. Without the budget for full marketing or PR departments, the marketing focus & initiatives of the project is left up to community creation and curation via social media channels & public forums. When economic incentives of the token holder community members don't align with the development goals of the project contributors the result is spammy and poor quality content being posted through these channels. The amount of content that can be posted is ultimately too vast to take the time to fully vet and endorse, so the quality of content and educational material suffers. This is disastrous for projects trying to recruit new users, as the amount of content a potential user needs to sift through to find something quality can cause the user to avoid the product altogether. 

_Inability to Incorporate Community Feedback into Roadmaps_

Historically, software projects do not stick to their original roadmaps. The fact that software projects miss deadlines on or chagne their roadmap is not a worthwhile critique to address. What is more pertinent is massive deviations from the roadmap and how a community reacts to such announcements. J

_Lack of Corporate Actions_

The ICO has created an interesting new vehicle for fundraising for networked organizations. Unfortunately we have yet to see it evolve beyond a single, major fundraising event due to an uncertain legal environment. Much of this hinges on the lack of an objective measurement by which a project may be assessed so it is difficult for legal institutions to make judgements about how to categorize it. Despite the best plans of project founders to avoid designing tokens that become securities, they often end up playing that role after the original business model fails. This leaves project founders to quietly pivot their business which often angers token holders. Permisionless networked organizations have an incredibly difficult time conveying what success will eventually look like, and conveying their vision of future success would look like. Along with this, major financial actions that might change the capital structure of a company to ensure continued operations are incredibly difficult to do in a decentralized way.

### Philosophy

_Structurelessness_

_Money vs Capital_

Money represents demand and capital represents the supply. Money is talked about in a way. Money is noise until it is aggregated and made sense of, and in economies with a single currency the aggregate numbers of demand likely represent whole industry demand and can only signal so much information to organizations who operate

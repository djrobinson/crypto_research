# Noise
## A Web3.0 Wrapper for Web2.0 Information Outlets 

### Abstract

This is a concept for a noise elimination app for social media channels dedicated to the discussion and marketing of open source software. It would be a layer on top of Twitter (initially) and other social media outlets that would allow users to more easily determine the vested interest of each participant in social media discussion and marketing and reduce spam. Noise will work by assigning identities to participants in discussion on open channels which will allow outsiders to determine the approximate function the individual has in the organization. By creating categorizations of individuals within a project we can then create formalized governance systems around pre-existing, but informal, social systems. The resulting categorizations can be combined with staking mechanisms to create all the properties required to allow permissionless open source projects to mimic the functions of a board of directors in a publicly owned company. Nudge focuses on engaging the external stakeholders of software project in a unique way to create apparent structure so that whole network of individuals that has an interest in the project can be involved in building the direction of the project.

### Intro

_Public Perception_

Most people hear of new software through Web2.0 social forums. Tools like Twitter, Github, Stackoverflow, Reddit, Discourse, Slack, Discord, and Telegram reign supreme in forming people's opinions around specific products or features. This is especially true of esoteric or brand new software projects where very few people have a working knowledge of the actual product. With the recent innovation of tying cryptocurrency valuation to the funding of open source project, the amount of noise on these social channels has become unbearable for people who are actually using and developing these projects. Discussion around price is often the dominant topic, and there is no barrier to entry into the conversation. Individuals can misrepresent their position, as we never know what interests members in the discussion maintain. Conflicts of interest are always assumed. This has led well-respected members of communities to withhold public support for fear of being misinterpreted as trying to pump a project. This means that intelligent conversation is often done behind closed doors via advisory positions, even though that discussion would be great to have on public forums for public edification. Without understanding individual's position in a project through some form of persistent identity leads to a massive public perception problem. The intentions of individuals promoting specific ideas on behalf of the project aren't easy to investigate, so to an uninformed observer of discussion all opinions are given similar amounts of consideration in the mind of the reader.

_Inexistence of Decentralized/Flat Organizations_

There is no such thing as pure decentralization. Operating in a truly "open environment" is impossible in practice when as there must be varying levels of permissions and authority to get anything done. The most obvious of these is the concept of a Benevolent Dictator for Life who maintains some special priviledge, such as merge permissions on a project, which assumes some final say in issues.  Sometimes the secrecy and efficiency of in-person closed-door interaction is still required due to the unexpected nature of any organization. There are times that special-purpose work groups are neccessary. All self-proclaimed "decentralized" or "open" projects will still have some element of closed & centralized work that would destroy the project if it were ever made public. Also, as anyone who has worked on a software project knows, private conversation is often the best way to vet bad ideas before they become broadly communicated. Temporary hierarchies and methods of determining relative legitimacy of actors are critical for simply getting things done. These relative measures of legitimacy, no matter how approximate, are beneficial to establish so that the community might be informed about who to go to for certain inquiries. An individual's position in the project is good to establish for outsiders to quickly assess the lay of the land when coming into a new network.

_Unified Marketing Messages_

When a project is leaderless, schisms in belief about how the technology is best applied are common. This problem is much worse when the economic factor of token appreciation or deprection is added to the equation. Without the budget for full marketing or PR departments, the marketing focus & initiatives of the project is left up to community creation and curation via social media channels & public forums. When economic incentives of the token holder community members don't align with the development goals of the project contributors the result is spammy and poor quality content being posted through these channels. The amount of content that can be posted is ultimately too vast to take the time to fully vet and endorse, so the quality of content and educational material suffers. This is disastrous for projects trying to recruit new users, as the amount of content a potential user needs to sift through to find something quality can cause the user to avoid the product altogether. 

_Inability to Gain Stakeholder Consensus Roadmaps_

Historically, software projects do not stick to their original roadmaps. The fact that software projects miss deadlines on or chagne their roadmap is not a worthwhile critique to address. Also, how a project
